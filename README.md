## Hej! I'm Ollie 🇬🇧🇸🇪
### I'm a Brit that's living and working in Sweden.

I do both projects work and consultancies for [techlove 💙](https://techlove.se/).

I'm primarily a backend developer, most confortable with anything to do with PHP - recently diving head strong into Laravel. However, you'll sometimes find me tinkering with a React frontend, or doing DevOps work. 

I'm passionate about diving deep; I like to truly understand the things I work with. That means I'll often be combing through the source-code to the frameworks I use, and diving deep into what is and isn't documented to try to understand more holistically how something works.

### And as I've been growing in my own personal development, I have found myself wanting to contribute more:

 🌕 Towards open source projects - particularly those I regularly use.
 
 🌕 Towards new and aspiring developers, helping them grow in knowledge and confidence.

 🌕 Towards teams; assisting in strengthening best practices and developing standards.


So hopefully you'll see my name popping up a little more, contributing to open-source 💻, stackoverflow 📨, and more.
